Her er en ferdig **prompt-fil** som gjør akkurat det du beskriver:

* Copilot skal gjøre en **gap-analyse av repoet**
* Lage en **rapport i `reports/`**
* **Opprette mappen** hvis den ikke finnes
* Rapporten skal inneholde **fil- og mappestruktur**, analyse av innhold og en kvalitetsvurdering

Lagre den som f.eks.:

```text
.github/prompts/repo-gap-analysis.prompt.md
```

# NORSAIN Repo Gap Analysis – File & Quality Review

You are a repository analysis assistant working ONLY inside the current repository
(e.g. `norsain-gpt-platform`). Your task is to perform a structured gap analysis of
the repo and write a Markdown report file under `reports/`.

## Overall Goal

- Inspect the repository structure and key files.
- Analyse file/folder structure, content and quality.
- Identify gaps against the intended architecture, standards and documentation.
- Write a clear, structured report to `reports/` (create the folder if it does not exist).

## Required Behaviour

1. **Work at repository root**
   - Assume the current workspace folder is the repository root.
   - Never reference files outside the repo.

2. **Create / use `reports/`**
   - If a `reports/` folder does not exist:
     - Create `reports/` at the repository root.
   - Create a new Markdown file with a timestamped name:
     - Example: `reports/repo-gap-analysis-YYYYMMDD.md`
   - All analysis goes into this file (not into existing docs).

3. **Report Structure**

The report MUST use this structure:

```md
# NORSAIN Repo Gap Analysis – <date>

## 1. Repository Overview
- Short description of the repo purpose.
- High-level summary of what you found.

## 2. File & Folder Structure
- A concise tree view (max depth 3–4).
- Highlight key areas: root config, agents/, scripts/, .github/, web/, docs/, reports/.

## 3. Configuration & Tooling
- Analyse: package.json, tsconfig, lint/format config, CI workflows.
- Comment on consistency, clarity, and missing scripts or checks.

## 4. GPT / Agents Area
- Analyse: agents/ (templates, instructions, actions, knowledge).
- Describe how well structure, naming and conventions are followed.
- Call out mismatches between template and documented standards.

## 5. Scripts & Automation
- Analyse: scripts/ and utils/.
- Evaluate code clarity, error handling, naming and DX.
- Identify missing validation or indexing logic compared to requirements.

## 6. Copilot & Developer Experience
- Analyse: .github/ (workflows, prompts, copilot-instructions, agent files).
- Check if Copilot instructions and prompt files match the actual repo layout.
- Identify gaps or inconsistencies in guidance vs. reality.

## 7. Content & Quality Assessment
- Comment on documentation quality (README, docs/, comments in code).
- Highlight strengths (clean structure, strict tooling, etc.).
- Highlight weaknesses (missing docs, unclear patterns, duplication, TODOs).

## 8. Gap Analysis & Risks
- List concrete gaps:
  - Missing files or folders compared to intended architecture.
  - Inconsistent naming or metadata.
  - Validation not enforcing documented rules.
  - Areas where standards are implied but not implemented.
- Classify each gap:
  - Priority: High / Medium / Low
  - Impact: Quality / DX / Risk / Maintainability

## 9. Recommendations & Next Actions
- Propose specific next steps:
  - New scripts, validations or checks.
  - Documentation updates.
  - Refactors or cleanups.
- Where possible, reference existing scripts (scaffold, validate, generate-index).

4. **Analysis Expectations**

   * Be concrete and technical.
   * Reference actual files and paths.
   * Prefer short bullet lists over long prose.
   * No emojis, no marketing language.

5. **Output Rules**

   * Do NOT print the report to the chat unless explicitly asked.
   * Write the report directly into `reports/repo-gap-analysis-YYYYMMDD.md`.
   * If you cannot modify files, then output the FULL report content so it can be saved manually.

You will now:

* Scan the repository.
* Create `reports/` if needed.
* Generate the complete report file with the structure above.

```
