# Domain Risks, Constraints & Failure Modes

## 1. Purpose

Identify domain-specific risks that affect operations, decision-making, compliance or data integrity.

## 2. Risk Categories

- Data corruption  
- Incomplete lineage  
- Invalid or partial input  
- Semantic drift across components  
- Version mismatch between artefacts  

## 3. Constraints

- regulatory compliance  
- quality gates  
- performance budgets  
- retention rules  
- immutability of published artefacts  

## 4. Failure Modes

- malformed schemas  
- lifecycle step skipping  
- incorrect version propagation  
- silent data truncation  

## 5. Early Warning Signals

- unexpected state transitions  
- deviations in metadata completeness  
- missing lineage items  
- anomalies in processing duration
